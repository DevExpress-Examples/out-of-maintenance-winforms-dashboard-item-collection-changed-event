# How to notify when a dashboard item is added, removed or duplicated

This example handles the [Dashboard.ItemCollectionChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.Dashboard.ItemCollectionChanged) event to obtain added or removed [dashboard items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116521/basic-concepts-and-terminology/dashboard-items).
Duplicated items have the identical [DashboardItem.Name](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardItem.Name) property values.
